# Reboot of HerdCanon

## Reboot?

While the original repository will remain online, I had to see that abandoning the project (I'm not sure why I did) lead to a very outdated system. Node and JavaScript develop fast and the items I used seem very obsolete to me.

The new HerdCanon system will be a more flexible approach, using an API backend that can be coupled with any number of backends, HTML5 App, Mobile App, whatever.

This is the server project part.
